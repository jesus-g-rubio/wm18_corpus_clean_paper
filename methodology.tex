\section{Corpus filtering as QE task}

Introduction to the approach, maybe with some diagram. List problems to be solved. One sub-section to explain each of them

\subsection{Features}
Description of all the features used, maybe clasifying them depending on which part of a good-parallel example they try to capture (adequacy, fluency, syntactic pleasure, ...)

\subsection{Classification Model}
Present the clasifier chosen and why (maybe enough saying in preliminary experiments it worked awesome)

\subsection{Training regime}
Explain the generation of negative examples
